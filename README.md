# Doc Generator Documentation

## Introduction

The **doc_generator** project is a Python-based tool designed to create documentation from various sources, including URLs, zipped archives, and local files. This documentation outlines the project's purpose, structure, and functionality.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the **doc_generator** project is to provide a flexible and reusable framework for generating documentation from different data sources. This project aims to simplify the process of creating high-quality documentation for software projects, products, or services.

## Structure

The **doc_generator** project consists of the following folders and files:

- **agents**: This folder contains agent files that are used to process and extract data from different sources.
- **langchain**: This folder houses the language chain functionality, which allows the project to handle natural language processing tasks.
- **.gitignore**: A configuration file that specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git during the version control process.
- **LangChain.yaml**: A YAML file that configures the language chain settings.
- **README.md**: The project's main documentation file.
- **agentmemory.db**: A database file used to store agent data.
- **docAgent.py**: Provides a class for generating documentation from local files.
- **docfromurl.py**: Enables the project to extract documentation from URLs.
- **docfromzip.py**: Allows the project to parse and extract documentation from zipped archives.
- **extractFromZip.py**: Contains a function to decompress and extract zipped files.

## Functionality

The **doc_generator** project offers the following key features:

- **Local File Processing**: The project can generate documentation from local files stored in the system.
- **URL-based Documentation**: Users can extract documentation from URLs using the `docfromurl.py` file.
- **Zip-based Documentation**: The project can parse and extract documentation from zipped archives using `docfromzip.py` and `extractFromZip.py`.
- **Agent-based Processing**: The agents folder contains agent files that can be used to process and extract data from different sources.

## Getting Started

To use the **doc_generator** project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adw777/doc_generator.git
   ```
2. Configure the language chain: Modify the settings in `LangChain.yaml` as needed.
3. Run the project: Execute the script by calling the `docAgent.py` file.

## Notes

Before using the **doc_generator** project, familiarize yourself with the following:

- The project uses Python 3 as the primary language.
- The `docAgent.py` file provides a basic example of how to generate documentation from local files.
- The `docfromurl.py` and `docfromzip.py` files offer more advanced features for extracting documentation from URLs and zipped archives, respectively.
