**Quality Prediction MLOps Project Documentation**

**Project Overview**

The Quality Prediction MLOps project is a Python-based implementation of a machine learning pipeline that predicts the quality of wine. The project utilizes a variety of libraries, including Flask, scikit-learn, and mlflow, to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

**Directory Structure**

The project directory structure is as follows:

* `src/mlProject` contains the project's source code
	+ `components`: contains reusable components of the pipeline
	+ `config`: contains configuration files for the pipeline
	+ `constants`: contains constants used throughout the pipeline
	+ `entity`: contains entity classes for the pipeline
	+ `pipeline`: contains pipeline classes for the project
	+ `utils`: contains utility functions for the pipeline
* `templates`: contains HTML templates for the Flask web interface
* `artifacts`: contains output artifacts from the pipeline (e.g. trained models, predictions)
* `config`: contains configuration files for the pipeline
* `requirements.txt`: contains dependencies for the project
* `README.md`: contains project documentation

**Flask Web Interface**

The project includes a Flask web interface that allows users to interact with the pipeline. The interface includes the following routes:

* `/`: displays the home page
* `/train`: trains the pipeline
* `/predict`: makes predictions on user input data

**Pipeline Overview**

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**: loads data from a source URL and extracts it to a local directory
2. **Data Validation**: validates the integrity of the data
3. **Data Transformation**: preprocesses the data for modeling
4. **Model Training**: trains a model on the preprocessed data
5. **Model Evaluation**: evaluates the performance of the trained model
6. **Model Prediction**: makes predictions on user input data using the trained model

**Components**

The project includes the following components:

* `DataIngestionConfig`: defines configuration for data ingestion
* `DataValidationConfig`: defines configuration for data validation
* `DataTransformationConfig`: defines configuration for data transformation
* `ModelTrainerConfig`: defines configuration for model training
* `ModelEvaluatorConfig`: defines configuration for model evaluation
* `PredictionPipeline`: defines the prediction pipeline
* `DataIngestion`: implements data ingestion
* `DataValidation`: implements data validation
* `DataTransformation`: implements data transformation
* `ModelTrainer`: implements model training
* `ModelEvaluator`: implements model evaluation
* `Prediction`: implements prediction

**Utilities**

The project includes the following utility functions:

* `read_yaml`: loads a YAML file into a ConfigBox object
* `create_directories`: creates a list of directories
* `save_json`: saves a dictionary to a JSON file
* `load_json`: loads a JSON file into a ConfigBox object
* `save_bin`: saves an object to a binary file
* `load_bin`: loads a binary file into an object
* `get_size`: returns the size of a file in KB

**Configuration Files**

The project includes the following configuration files:

* `config/config.yaml`: defines configuration for the pipeline
* `params.yaml`: defines parameters for the pipeline
* `schema.yaml`: defines the schema for the pipeline

**Requirements**

The project requires the following libraries:

* Flask
* scikit-learn
* mlflow
* numpy
* pandas
* joblib
* yaml

**Deployment**

The project can be deployed using the following commands:

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python setup.py sdist`
* `twine upload dist/*`

**Usage**

To use the project, simply run `python app.py` and access the Flask web interface at `http://localhost:8080`. From there, you can train the pipeline, make predictions on user input data, and view the output artifacts from the pipeline.
