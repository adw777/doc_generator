Quality Prediction MLOPs Project
=====================================

Overview
------------

The Quality Prediction MLOPs Project is a GitHub repository created to demonstrate a production-grade machine learning pipelines using MLflow. The project's primary goal is to develop and deploy high-quality machine learning models that can predict certain quality-related parameters.

Project Structure
--------------------

The project's structure is organized as follows:

*   config/: Contains configuration files for the project, including config.yaml and schema.yaml.
*   logs/: Stores log files for the project.
*   mlruns/: Contains experiment logs and tracking data for the MLflow experiment.
*   research/: Houses research-related materials and documentation.
*   src/: The project's main source code directory, containing the application logic and business logic.
*   static/: Stores static assets and files for the project.
*   template/: Contains templates for the project.
*   .gitignore: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
*   Dockerfile: Specifies the instructions for building the Docker image.
*   README.md: The project's main documentation file, containing information about the project, its structure, and usage instructions.
*   app.py: The main application entry point.
*   main.py: A secondary main entry point.
*   params.yaml: Specifies the project's parameters.
*   requirements.txt: Lists the project's dependencies.
*   schema.yaml: Defines the project's schema.
*   setup.py: Specifies the project's setup and installation requirements.
*   template.py: A template file for the project.
*   test.py: The project's test file.

Functionality
----------------

The project uses MLflow to create a production-grade machine learning pipeline. It includes the following key components:

   Experiment Tracking: The project uses MLflow to track experiments and model performance.
   Model Logging: Models are logged and stored for future reference.
   Model Serving: The project provides ways to serve and deploy models.
   Model Monitoring: The project allows for model monitoring and performance tracking.

Usage
------------

Prerequisites

*   Install the required Python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
*   Create a conda environment using conda create -n mlproj python=3.8 -y and activate it using conda activate mlproj.
*   Configure the MLflow tracking URI, username, and password using the following environment variables:
       MLFLOWTRACKING_URI=https://dagshub.com/randomvariable/Quality-Prediction-MLOPs-Project.mlflow
       MLFLOWTRACKING_USERNAME=randomvariable
       MLFLOWTRACKING_PASSWORD=6824692c47a369aa6f9eac5b10041d5c8edbcef0

Running the Project

1.  Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/KISHAN8888/Quality-Prediction-MLOPs-Project.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the application using python app.py.

Viewing the MLflow Interface

1.  Start the MLflow interface using mlflow ui.
2.  Initialize the MLflow experiment using dagshub.init(repoowner='randomvariable', reponame='Quality-Prediction-MLOPs-Project', mlflow=True).

Tips and Recommendations
---------------------------

*   Use a virtual environment to ensure dependencies are isolated and managed cleanly.
*   Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment.
*   Use a Docker container to package the application and make it portable.
*   Monitor model performance and adjust the pipeline as needed.

By following these guidelines and recommendations, you can create a robust and maintainable machine learning pipeline using MLflow and the Quality Prediction MLOPs Project.
