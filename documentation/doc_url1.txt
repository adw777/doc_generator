=====================================================

Overview
--------

The Echo project is an implementation of a "second brain" chatbot that can summarize conversations, store summaries and embeddings in a database, and then take queries to return relevant summaries from past conversations.

Purpose
--------

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end pipeline for the "second brain" concept, where past knowledge is available to inform future responses. This is achieved by storing conversational history in a searchable database and using it to generate responses to user queries.

Project Structure
-------------------

The project consists of the following components:

1. Speech Transcription

*   Uses the SpeechRecognition library to record from the microphone and transcribe audio to text.

2. Conversation Summarization

*   Utilizes Google's Palm language model to generate a concise summary while retaining key information.

3. Database Storage

*   Stores the summary and its vector embedding for each conversation in a MongoDB database.

4. Sentence Embeddings

*   Encodes the summary text into a dense vector representation using the SentenceTransformers semantic search framework.

5. User Query

*   Allows the user to enter a text query and retrieve relevant past summaries.

6. Summary Retrieval

*   Uses MongoDB's vector similarity search to match the user query embedding against stored summary embeddings.

7. Response Generation

*   Utilizes the Palm language model to generate a response by conditioning on the most relevant retrieved summary.

Technical Details
-------------------

Technologies Used

   SpeechRecognition: A library for speech-to-text functionality.
   Palm Language Model: A state-of-the-art language model for text summarization.
   MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing summaries and vector embeddings.
   SentenceTransformers: A framework for semantic search and sentence embeddings.

Components

*   The project consists of a main.py file, which serves as the entry point for the application.
